# Shuttle's Christmas Code Hunt

Shuttle's Christmas Code Hunt, inspired by Advent of Code, invites you to solve daily challenges using Rust in a relaxed environment. Each weekday, you will be implementing an HTTP endpoint that returns the solution to the daily challenge, and deploy it on [Shuttle](https://www.shuttle.rs/). Join the fun, solve puzzles, embrace the holiday spirit, and get rewarded! ðŸŽ„ðŸš€
